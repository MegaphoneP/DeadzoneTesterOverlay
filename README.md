This is a very simple program I slapped together with the help of Grok and Gemini. It's designed to help you find the exact perfect deadzone for use with Steam Input Gyro to Joystick Camera.
It also has a mapping feature that lets you roughly map out the shape of the actual deadzone. If possible, I think it would be great if Valve would add settings to try and account for deadzone shape if possible.
